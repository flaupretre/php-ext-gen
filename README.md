# php-ext-gen

A PHP extension generator.

For details, please refer to the [wiki documentation](https://github.com/flaupretre/php-ext-gen/wiki).

This is an alpha version. Only code to define functions, constants, and INI entries is generated, and the only implemented generator is PHP5 (PHP7 and HHVM are planned).
